So far we did not find out about any non-standard battery optimizations on HTC. It seems the standard AOSP doze mode restrictions apply if your are on Android 6+ as described below.

Below are direct copypastes from their [website](https://www.htc.com/us/support/htc-one-m9/howto/696906.html).
When you have connections such as Wi‍-Fi on while the phone is in sleep mode, some apps may still continue to use the battery. Starting from Android 6.0, battery optimization is enabled for all apps by default which helps prolong battery standby time when you’re not using the phone.
The phone needs to be sitting idle for an extended period of time before battery optimization takes effect.
