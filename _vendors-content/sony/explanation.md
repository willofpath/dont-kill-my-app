For recent Android versions on Sony devices, AOSP's Battery saver mode is rebranded as **STAMINA mode**. If left on default settings, it behaves close to AOSP, but there is an additional opt-in setting under STAMINA mode called **Prefer battery time** which will have more aggressive limitations on background activity.

For older devices, Sony gets a high bar in our listing of toxic Android vendors, as historically Sony introduced the first very effective non-standard background process optimization and opened Pandora's box. STAMINA mode on their older devices instantly breaks all background processes and all alarms if enabled.
