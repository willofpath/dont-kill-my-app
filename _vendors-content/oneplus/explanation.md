OnePlus and their OxygenOS Android modification is known for maximizing the stock Android experience. This may be true on the UX front but the exact opposite is valid for background process limits.


When releasing their 1+5 and 1+6 phones, OnePlus introduced one of the most severe background limits on the market to date, dwarfing even those performed by Xiaomi or Huawei. Not only did users need to enable extra settings to make their apps work properly, but those settings even got reset with firmware updates. So apps break again and users are required to re-enable those settings on a regular basis.
