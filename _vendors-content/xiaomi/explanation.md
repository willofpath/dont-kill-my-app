Traditionally, Xiaomi and their Android customization called _MIUI_ belongs in the most troubled group on the market with respect to non-standard background process limitations and non-standard permissions.
There are no APIs and no documentation for those extensions. In default settings, background processing simply does not work right and apps using them will break.


> **Note**: Android One devices by Xiaomi work much better than MIUI-based devices. So, if you like Xiaomi, we definitely recommend looking for their Android One offering.
